# Set up
```{r}
cov <- read.table("covid19.csv", sep=",",header=TRUE)
# cov$CMODateCount #

# the simple model that allows for departure from unbounded exponential growth
N = function(t, n0, beta) {
  val = exp(n0)
  for (i in seq_along(beta)) {
    val = val * exp(beta[i]*t^i)
  }
  val
}
```


# Question 1
```{r}
# produces function to evaluate the negative log likelihood of the model
# y ~ Poi(N(t))

neg_loglike = function(theta,y) {
  n0 = theta[1]
  beta = theta[2:length(theta)]
  n = length(y)
  t = seq(-1, 1, length.out=n) # run from -1 to 1 so model is invariant to units that time is measure in, so it doesn't matter if time is measure in seconds, days, or months.
  ll <-sum(dpois(y, N(t, n0, beta), log=TRUE)) # log likelihood of model
  -ll # negative log likelihood of model
}

# produces a function to work out AIC of the model
AIC = function(num_par, val_ll) {
  2*val_ll + 2 * num_par # note that it's not -2*val_ll since val_ll is already negative
}
```


# Question 2
```{r}
# fits models with K values from 1 to 5, finds the MLE for theta, finds AIC

for (K in 1:5) {
  theta0 = integer(K+1) # initial parameter values
  
  # finds the MLE for theta using optim
  theta.hat = optim(theta0, neg_loglike, method="BFGS", y=cov$CMODateCount)
  
  n0 = theta.hat$par[1]
  beta = theta.hat$par[2:length(theta.hat$par)]
  
  t = seq(-1, 1, length.out=length(cov$CMODateCount))
  
 # produce a plot of how well the model fits the data for K from 1 to 5
  
  with(cov,plot(1:41,cov$CMODateCount, main = "Number of new cases per day from 31/01/2020 to 11/03/2020",xlab = "Day No.", ylab = "Number of new cases"))
  
  e = exp(n0)
  for (i in seq_along(beta)) {
    e = e * exp(beta[i] * t^i)
  }

  lines(1:length(cov$CMODateCount), e, col="red")
  legend("topleft", legend=paste("Model when K value = ", K), col="red", lty=1:2, cex=0.8)
  aic <- AIC(length(theta0), theta.hat$value)
  cat("AIC for ", K, " is: ", aic, "\n")
}

##Comment: By comparing the AIC values for each K from 1 to 5, the model with K=3 (i.e. 4 parameters) is the best model because it has the lowest AIC value. By minimising AIC, we minimise the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This implies the model with K=4 is the model that is the closest to the true model in the probabilistic average sense. 
```


# Question 2 Continued
```{r}
# We want to test whether the model when K=4 can be simplified or not.
# Null hypothesis: the model with K=3 (Model A) is a good fit to the data
# Alternative hypothesis: the model with K=4 (Model B) is a good fit to the data
# We will conduct the hypothesis test using a generalised likelihood ratio statistic (GLRT) because Model A is nested in Model B. In addition, GLRT generalises the Neyman-Pearson test statistic which is the most powerful in simple hypotheses setting.


# H0
K0 = 3 
par0 = integer(K0+1) # dimension of theta in H0
theta0 = optim(par0, neg_loglike, method="BFGS", y=cov$CMODateCount) # MLE for theta when K=3

# H1
K1 = 4
par1 = integer(K1+1) # dimension of theta in H1
theta1 = optim(par1, neg_loglike, method="BFGS", y=cov$CMODateCount) # MLE for theta when K=4

t = 2 * (theta0$value - theta1$value) # GLRT test statisic
p <- 1- pchisq(t,df=1) # degree of freedom is 1 because H0 imposes 1 restriction on the parameter vector
p # p-value

# Comment: since the p-value is very small, it implies that our data is not very consistent with H0 being true. Therefore, there is very strong evidence of rejecting H0. This implies the model when K=4 cannot be simplified further.  
```


# Question 3
```{r}

K1 = 4
par = integer(K1+1)

theta1 = optim(par=par, loglike, method="BFGS", y=cov$CMODateCount, hessian = TRUE)

# the inverse of the hessian is the covariance matrix
covar = solve(theta1$hessian)
print("The approximate covariance matrix is: ", quote=FALSE)
covar
```

```{r}
### Question 4 ###
se <- sqrt(diag(covar))

ci.lower = rep(0,5)
ci.upper = rep(0,5)
for (i in 1:5) {
  ci.lower <- theta1$par[i]-1.96*se[i]
  ci.upper = theta1$par[i]+1.96*se[i]
}

print(" 95% confidence interval for estimates of log(N(t))", quote = FALSE)
cat("the lower bound is: ", sum(ci.lower), "\n")
cat("the upper bound is: ", sum(ci.upper), "\n")
